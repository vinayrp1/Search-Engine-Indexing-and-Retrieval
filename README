INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE SCRIPTS:
--------------------------------

- To generate inverted index, run 
		
		python indexer.py <corpusfilename> <invertedindex_filename>
    
    Default corpusfilename -> "tccorpus.txt"
    Default invertedindex_filename -> "index.out"

- To obtain the list of BM25 ranked documents, run

		python bm25.py <invertedindex_filename> <queries_file> <length_of_top_ranked_doc_list>

		Defaults:
			
			- invertedindex_filename -> "index.out"
			- queries_file -> "queries.txt"
			- length_of_top_ranked_doc_list -> 100

DESCRIPTION OF THE APPROACH:
----------------------------

- To calculate bm25 score of each document, following data structures are used

	1. inverted_list: A dictionary which holds all the tokens as the keys and 
						the list of <docID, tf> pairs

	2. doc_len: A dictionary which holds all the docIDs as the keys and the document 
					length as its values

	3. results: This is a dictionary which consists of the queries from given queries
				file as keys and the dictionary consisting of <key -> docID, value -> bm25_score> 
				as their values
